# SmartShoppingCart
This project is a menu-style item list viewer using an Arduino Uno and a 16x2 I2C LCD display, designed to simulate a basic inventory or transaction viewer interface with minimal hardware. It provides scrolling, deletion, and dynamic text display with an intuitive button-controlled interaction system.
